<p>While writing code, it is helpful to add a bit of text to explain the code or leave a note for yourself. It is a good programming practice to add comments in the code explaining each step. In JavaScript, you can prefix any line with two forward slashes // to make it a comment. The text in the comment will be ignored by the interpreter and will not be executed.</p>
<pre>// This is a comment!</pre>
<p>The Code Editor also provides a shortcut—Ctrl + / on Windows, Cmd + / on Mac—to comment or uncomment multiple lines simultaneously. You can select multiple lines and press the key combination to make them all comments. Press again to reverse the operation. This is helpful when debugging code to stop certain parts of the script from being executed.</p>
