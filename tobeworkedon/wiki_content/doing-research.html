<p>Geography is the study of the earth's surface and features, including its physical and cultural landscapes. Remote sensing is a powerful tool that enables geographers to collect data about the earth's surface from a distance without visiting the site physically. This technology has revolutionized how geographers study the world, providing an efficient and effective way to answer research questions. However, to make the most of remote sensing technology, it is essential to develop research questions that are easily answered through remote sensing and to formulate a methodological approach that will allow you to collect and analyze the necessary data. This lesson will outline how to write research questions for geography with a remote sensing approach.</p>
<p><em><strong>Developing Research Questions for Remote Sensing</strong></em></p>
<p>The first step in developing research questions for remote sensing is to identify areas where remote sensing can be used effectively. For example, remote sensing can study land use and land cover changes, vegetation dynamics, and urbanization patterns. Once you have identified an area of study, you need to develop a set of research questions that can be answered through remote sensing. These research questions should be specific, measurable, and relevant to your study area. They should also be answerable with the data available through remote sensing.</p>
<p>For example, a research question might be "How has land use and land cover changed in the Amazon Rainforest over the past decade?" This question is specific, measurable, and relevant to studying land use and land cover changes. It can also be answered using remote sensing data, such as satellite imagery and digital elevation models.</p>
<p><em><strong>Formulating a Methodological Approach</strong></em></p>
<p>Once you have developed a set of research questions, the next step is formulating a methodological approach to answer those questions. This approach should include a detailed plan for collecting and analyzing remote sensing data. The first step is to identify the type of remote sensing data used, such as satellite imagery, LiDAR data, or aerial photographs.</p>
<p>Next, you need to determine the spatial and temporal resolution of the data you will collect. For example, if you are studying land use and land cover changes, you will need to select satellite imagery with a high enough spatial resolution to identify changes in land use over time. You will also need to consider the temporal resolution of the data, which refers to how often the data is collected. In some cases, you may need to collect multiple images over time to track changes in the landscape.</p>
<p>Once you have collected the necessary data, you will need to preprocess it to remove any noise or errors that may be present. This may involve image calibration, atmospheric correction, and geometric correction, depending on the data type you are working with.</p>
<p>Finally, you must analyze the data to answer your research questions. This may involve image classification, change detection, or spatial analysis. The specific methodological approach will depend on what you're trying to answer and the data you've collected.</p>
<p><em><strong>Stating Expected Hypotheses</strong></em></p>
<p>In addition to developing research questions and a methodological approach, it is also important to state the expected hypotheses for your study. Hypotheses are statements that predict the outcome of your research based on existing knowledge and observations. They provide a framework for testing the validity of your research questions and can help you interpret your findings.</p>
<p>For example, an expected hypothesis for the research question "How has land use and land cover changed in the Amazon Rainforest over the past decade?" might be "Land use in the Amazon Rainforest has increased over the past decade, leading to a decrease in forest cover and an increase in agricultural land." This hypothesis is based on existing knowledge of deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest and can be tested using remote sensing data.</p>
<p><em><strong>Incorporating Context and Broader Impacts</strong></em></p>
<p>It is important to consider the broader impacts of research when writing research questions. This means that the researchers should think about how the research could be used to improve people's lives or protect the environment.</p>
<p>The broader impacts can be positive or negative. It is important to be aware of the potential impacts so that the research can be conducted in a way that maximizes the positive and minimizes the negative impacts.</p>
<p>By considering the context, broader impacts, and hypothesis, researchers can write research questions that are well-suited to remote sensing and can lead to valuable insights.</p>
