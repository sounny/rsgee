<p>Discrete data refers to data that can only take on certain numerical values, often integers. This type of data is limited to a finite number of possible outcomes. It is typically used to represent counts or whole numbers, such as the number of people in a household or the number of students in a class. On the other hand, continuous data can take on any value within a given range or interval. This type of data is often measured and can include fractions or decimals, such as temperature or weight.</p>
<p>In the context of machine learning, regression models predict continuous variables, whereas classification models predict discrete or categorical variables with a finite number of categories. For example, a regression model may be used to predict the price of a house based on its features, whereas a classification model may be used to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on their demographic information.</p>
<p>In remote sensing, image classification is the process of categorizing every pixel in an image into a limited number of labeled land cover and/or land use classes. This resulting classified image provides a simplified thematic map.&nbsp; In this way, classification is taking a continuous dataset, a remote sensing image, and turning it into a discrete dataset, a thematic map.&nbsp;</p>
