<p><span>To perform this type of study, a global dataset with a relatively high spatial resolution must gather enough data points.&nbsp; Furthermore, because snow cover can be such an ephemeral event, a high temporal resolution is also required.&nbsp; Fortunately, NASA’s Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, more commonly called MODIS, meets these requirements.&nbsp; This pair of twin satellites, MODIS Terra and Aqua, orbits the planet following what is known as a sun-synchronous, near-polar, circular orbit and crosses the equator approximately 3 hours apart, collecting 36 individual bands to measure surface conditions.&nbsp; This daily temporal coverage is far more appropriate to mapping ephemeral events such as snow cover than the higher spatial resolution Landsat family of satellites, which have a temporal resolution of ~16 days.&nbsp; MODIS has been continuously measuring the globe since its placement in orbit in 2000 and 2002 for Terra and Aqua, respectively.</span></p>
<div><span>MODIS can image the globe at such a high temporal resolution partially because of its orbital path, and&nbsp;partially&nbsp;because the sensor can scan at very wide angles. &nbsp;However, at high sensor zenith angles, observations can be thrown off by the change in reflectance and cause false readings. &nbsp;It is, therefore, standard practice in the literature to limit the valid observations to only those observations that have a sensor zenith angle of less than 25<sup>o</sup>. &nbsp;This is done because, at 25<sup>o</sup>, the imaged pixel is 110% of the nominal area at nidar (directly below the satellite). &nbsp;</span></div>

<div><span>There are several MODIS data products, but the one of&nbsp;importance&nbsp;is known as MOD10A1. &nbsp;This dataset was processed from the raw data to create a daily snow cover dataset. &nbsp;There are 4 bands in the dataset, but the one of&nbsp;interest&nbsp;to us here is the&nbsp;Snow_Cover_Daily_Tile band that codes for the state of land cover with respect to snow. &nbsp;We will also need the MOD09GA&nbsp;sensor zenith band to remove the pixels with a high sensor zenith angle.</span></div>
