<p>Rivers are not just water channels; they are dynamic systems that change shape, size, and direction due to various natural processes. Understanding these changes is crucial for various fields like environmental science, urban planning, and even disaster management. In geography, these studies happen in fluvial geomorphology, a subdiscipline of geomorphology that studies how rivers shape the Earth's surface. It focuses on understanding how river processes change over time.</p>
<p>In this lab, we aim to leverage the power of Earth Engine to explore some key aspects of river systems. You'll learn how to distinguish a river from other water bodies using satellite imagery. We'll also get into the weeds of river morphology by calculating its centerline and width. &nbsp;Then, we will go a step further to analyze how rivers change over time by calculating bank erosion rates.</p>
<p><em><strong>By the end of this lab, you'll have a good grasp of how to:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Distinguish rivers from other water bodies</li>
<li>Perform basic morphological analyses on rivers</li>
<li>Detect changes in river forms over time</li>
</ul>
