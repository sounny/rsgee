<p>In this module, you will be walking in the footstep of remote sensing scientists conducting lengthy research projects with Earth Engine! This is supposed to give you the feel of what working on your final projects could be like. In this course, you gained hands-on experience working with one of the most powerful geospatial analysis platforms available today. &nbsp;You have learned how to use Earth Engine to analyze large datasets, visualize geospatial information, and apply advanced analysis techniques to solve real-world problems. Today you will test the limit of those skills with these case studies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best of luck and happy mapping.</p>
