&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The UF GeoGator Summer Undergraduate Research Experience is a research opportunity for undergraduate students to participate in an active research project with a faculty member in the Geography department. The program provides students with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience, the chance to be involved with cutting edge research and lab environments, the opportunity to identify and develop career-related skills and abilities, and also provide a chance to network with professionals.&amp;nbsp;This program aims to prepare students for future careers by gaining valuable and marketable experience, and expanding their knowledge beyond the classroom.
