<p>Throughout the semester, you will work to do novel research using Remote Sensing and Digital Image Processing.&nbsp; To start this series of work, I would like you to brainstorm some research questions on your interests.&nbsp; This will be the draft of the research questions section of your final term paper.&nbsp; For the scope to fit this class, you may have to have a very simple research question.&nbsp; The requirements of your research question are:</p>
<ul>
<li>You utilize Remote Sensing Image Processing Platforms like ENVI, ERDAS, Google Earth Engine, or ArcGIS Pro.</li>
<li>You Process Remote Sensing Data Products to create new derivative datasets</li>
<li>You create a visualization to communicate your results and enhance your analysis.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>For the research question, it is your choice if you want to do a Remote Sensing Application or if you want to do pure Remote Sensing research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of Pure Remote Sensing Research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Error Propagation through different scales of remote sensing products</li>
<li>Pixel mixing or remote sensing data.</li>
<li>Evaluations of various products for set workflows</li>
<li>Evaluate various approaches to the same problem and dataset to see impacts on conclusions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Development of novel processes for remote sensing datasets</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of Applied Remote Sensing Research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measuring dynamics of landscape changes due to climate change.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Studying edge effects of conservation zones of ecosystem</li>
<li>Determining deforestation rates in regions</li>
<li>Estimating carb sequestration from forest regrowth</li>
<li>Hydrological modeling with elevation models to determine the Hydrography of an area</li>
</ul>
<p>The list can go on forever.&nbsp; What you want to do is submit a 1-page summary of what you would like to study to get some feedback and guidance on how to formulate the final question and scope of your project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: If you are a graduate student, I would like you to formulate your question on the research topic you are doing for your thesis or dissertation.</strong></em></p>
