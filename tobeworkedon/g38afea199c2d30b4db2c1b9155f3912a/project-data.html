<p>Now that you have an idea of your research questions, you need to start looking at the datasets that may possibly limit your work.&nbsp; Most remote sensing research is the art of advancing science with very limited data.&nbsp; Many times our research questions are limited but data availability.&nbsp; I want you to look out for what datasets you could use for your project.&nbsp; Sometimes with imagination and innovation, you can figure out ways to answer your questions with limited data.&nbsp; Outline what data you will use, where you will get it, and what type of processing you plan on doing with it.&nbsp;</p>
