<title>Assignment: Imagery Analysis Results and Draft Paper (Optional)</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>For your final project in this remote sensing class, you will work on a research paper incorporating the techniques and tools you have learned throughout the course. This paper should be based on a straightforward research question that utilizes remote sensing data and analytical tools to provide answers or insights.</p>
<p>We offer an early submission review opportunity to help you prepare for the final submission. This means you will submit a draft version of your paper for feedback, allowing you to make necessary improvements before submitting the final version.&nbsp; You can also submit imagery results as well if you do not have a draft of your final paper done&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your paper should be between 3-20 pages in length and should include the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figures: Include maps and graphs of your results to support your research question and analysis.</li>
<li>Workflow: Provide a straightforward workflow of the processes you have used to analyze your data and reach your conclusions.</li>
<li>Datasets: Include a table of the datasets used in your research, including their sources and spatial and spectral resolutions.</li>
<li>Straightforward research question: Clearly state your research question and explain why it is relevant to remote sensing.</li>
<li>Results: Include a section that answers your research question or explains why it could not be answered.</li>
<li>Future works: Discuss work that could build upon your research and how it could be improved.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use any citation format you prefer, but the field of Geography and the instructor prefers APA style.</p>
<p>Remember, this early submission review aims to give you feedback on your draft work. Therefore, it is essential that you submit your draft paper as early as possible, giving you enough time to incorporate the feedback before submitting the final version.</p>
<p>We encourage you to take advantage of this early submission review opportunity, as it will help you improve the quality of your final paper and, ultimately, your overall grade in the course.</p>
