<p><strong>LAND USE <span style="font-size: 18pt;">≠ </span>LAND COVER</strong></p>
<p>Understanding land use and cover concepts is essential for image classification. Land cover refers to the physical and biophysical properties of the Earth's surface, such as vegetation, water bodies, and impervious surfaces, which can be identified through remote sensing techniques. By analyzing and categorizing these land covers, we can gain valuable information about the state and condition of different regions of the Earth's surface.</p>
<p>On the other hand, land use refers to the human activities on the land and how they interact with the land cover. Land use encompasses various activities, such as agriculture, urbanization, industrialization, transportation, and recreation. Land use is often related to social, economic, and cultural factors, and it can vary significantly across regions and countries.</p>
<p>For example, a forest can be a land cover in one area and be used for logging or hunting. In contrast, the same forest may be a protected area in another region, primarily for ecological conservation and recreation. Similarly, herbaceous vegetation such as grass can indicate different land uses. In rural areas, it may be used for grazing livestock, while in urban areas, it may be part of a park or green space.</p>
