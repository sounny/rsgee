        <h1>Earth from Space</h1>
        <h2>NOVA Documentary</h2>

        <section>
            <p>Excellent video from <strong>NOVA Season 40 Episode 6</strong>. Please watch to get a general idea of what we will be doing in this class.</p>

            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p><em>"Earth From Space" is a groundbreaking two-hour special that reveals a spectacular new space-based vision of our planet. Produced in extensive consultation with NASA scientists, NOVA takes data from earth-observing satellites and transforms it into dazzling visual sequences, each one exposing the intricate and surprising web of forces that sustains life on earth.</em></p>
            
            <p><em>Viewers witness how dust blown from the Sahara fertilizes the Amazon; how a vast submarine "waterfall" off Antarctica helps drive ocean currents around the world; and how the Sun's heating up of the southern Atlantic gives birth to a colossally powerful hurricane. From the microscopic world of water molecules vaporizing over the ocean to the magnetic field that is bigger than Earth itself, the show reveals the astonishing beauty and complexity of our dynamic planet.</em></p>

            <p>As you watch this documentary, consider how it relates to what you're learning in this course:</p>
            
            <h3>Satellite Sensors</h3>
            <p>The documentary showcases data from various satellite missions—similar sensors are available in Google Earth Engine for your analysis.</p>

            <h3>Multi-Spectral Imaging</h3>
            <p>Notice how different wavelengths reveal different Earth features, just as you'll work with different spectral bands in your labs.</p>

            <h3>Time Series Analysis</h3>
            <p>The animations of Earth processes over time demonstrate the power of temporal analysis that you'll perform with image collections.</p>

            <h3>Global Scale Analysis</h3>
            <p>The documentary's planetary perspective illustrates the scale at which remote sensing can operate—something Google Earth Engine makes accessible to you.</p>
