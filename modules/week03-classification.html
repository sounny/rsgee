                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Image classification is a critical task in remote sensing that involves categorizing image pixels into 
                distinct classes or categories based on their spectral characteristics. This process is essential in identifying 
                land use, vegetation cover, water bodies, and other features on the earth's surface. Classification is a 
                multi-step process that requires a thorough understanding of the image data, the available classifiers, and the 
                desired output.</p>

                <h2>The Classification Process</h2>
                
                <h3>Step 1: Data Mining (Finding the Data)</h3>
                <p>One of the first steps in image classification is data collection, which involves acquiring imagery of the area 
                of interest. The imagery can be obtained from various sources, such as satellites, aircraft, or drones. Once the 
                imagery is obtained, it is essential to preprocess the data to remove any noise and correct for atmospheric 
                effects.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/diagrams/0_xALkI7HzKTqq6jTa.jpg" alt="Diagram showing different approaches to Machine Learning" loading="lazy">
                    <figcaption>Different approaches to Machine Learning in classification</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Step 2: Planning Your Classification Approach</h3>
                <p>After preprocessing the data, the next step is selecting a classifier to classify the pixels into the desired 
                categories accurately. Numerous classification algorithms are available, such as maximum likelihood, support 
                vector machines, random forest, and neural networks. The choice of the classifier depends on the image data's 
                characteristics and the classification task's complexity.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Create a Training Sample</h3>
                <p>Once the classifier is selected, the next step is to train the classifier by creating a training sample. This 
                process involves selecting representative samples from the image data and labeling them according to their 
                corresponding classes. The sample data is then used to train the classifier, and the resulting model can be tested 
                using validation data.</p>

                <h3>Step 4: Run Classification</h3>
                <p>The final step in image classification is the actual classification of the image data. This process involves 
                applying the trained classifier to the entire image and assigning each pixel to its corresponding class. The 
                resulting classified image can be used for various applications such as land use planning, environmental 
                monitoring, and resource management.</p>

                <div class="note">
                    <p>Overall, image classification is a complex and iterative process requiring technical knowledge, domain 
                    expertise, and creativity. With the vast array of tools and techniques available in Earth Engine, users can 
                    create accurate and detailed classifications that can inform decision-making and promote sustainable 
                    development.</p>

                <h2>Types of Image Classification</h2>
                <p>The three main types of image classification techniques in remote sensing are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unsupervised image classification</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Supervised image classification</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Object-based image analysis</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>1. Unsupervised Classification</h3>
                <p>Unsupervised classification involves grouping pixels into clusters based on their properties and then 
                classifying each cluster with a land cover class. Overall, unsupervised classification is the most basic 
                technique. Because you don't need samples for unsupervised classification, it's an easy way to segment and 
                understand an image.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/diagrams/unsupervised-diagram.png" alt="Unsupervised Classification Diagram" loading="lazy">
                    <figcaption>Unsupervised classification workflow</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p><strong>The two basic steps for unsupervised classification are:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Generate clusters</li>
                    <li>Assign classes</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Common image clustering algorithms:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>K-means</li>
                    <li>ISODATA</li>
                </ul>

                <p>After picking a clustering algorithm, you identify the number of groups you want to generate. For example, you 
                can create 8, 20, or 42 clusters. Fewer clusters have more resembling pixels within groups. But more clusters 
                increase the variability within groups.</p>

                <div class="warning">
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> These are unclassified clusters. The next step is to assign land cover classes 
                    to each cluster manually.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>2. Supervised Classification</h3>
                <p>Supervised classification involves selecting representative samples for each land cover class, which the 
                software then uses as training sites to classify the entire image.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/diagrams/supervised-diagram.png" alt="Supervised Classification Diagram" loading="lazy">
                    <figcaption>Supervised classification workflow</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p><strong>The three basic steps for supervised classification are:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select training areas</li>
                    <li>Generate signature file</li>
                    <li>Classify</li>
                </ol>

                <p>For supervised image classification, you first create training samples. For example, you mark urban areas by 
                identifying them in the image. Then, you would continue adding training sites representative in the entire image. 
                You continue creating training samples for each land cover class until you have representative samples for each 
                class. This would generate a signature file, which stores all training samples' spectral information.</p>

                <p><strong>Common classification algorithms:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maximum likelihood</li>
                    <li>Minimum-distance</li>
                    <li>Principal components</li>
                    <li>Support vector machine (SVM)</li>
                    <li>Random Forest</li>
                    <li>CART (Classification and Regression Trees)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA)</h3>
                <p>Object-based image analysis differs from the pixel-based approach in supervised and unsupervised 
                classification. It groups pixels into representative vector shapes with size and geometry. Object-based 
                classification is particularly useful for analyzing high-resolution data.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/diagrams/object-based-diagram.png" alt="Object-Based Classification Diagram" loading="lazy">
                    <figcaption>Object-based classification workflow</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p><strong>Steps to perform object-based image analysis classification:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Perform multiresolution segmentation</li>
                    <li>Select training areas</li>
                    <li>Define statistics</li>
                    <li>Classify</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Classification criteria in OBIA:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SHAPE:</strong> Tests an object's geometry (e.g., "rectangular fit" for buildings)</li>
                    <li><strong>TEXTURE:</strong> Measures the homogeneity of an object</li>
                    <li><strong>SPECTRAL:</strong> Uses mean values of spectral properties</li>
                    <li><strong>GEOGRAPHIC CONTEXT:</strong> Considers proximity and distance relationships</li>
                </ul>
