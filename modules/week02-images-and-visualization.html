                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This week we dive deeper into working with satellite imagery in Google Earth Engine. You'll learn about the 
                additive color system used for displaying images, how to work with image collections, and how to calculate 
                spectral indices to extract meaningful information from satellite data.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="additive-color">
                <h2>The Additive Color System</h2>
                <p>The Additive Color System is a method used in digital displays to create colors by mixing varying levels of 
                Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) light. Each color is represented by a three-digit number that forms a pixel. Adjusting 
                these RGB values allows for a wide range of colors, from black (0, 0, 0) to white (255, 255, 255).</p>

                <p>In Earth Engine and other digital displays, the data is shown using these RGB channels. Each band's Digital 
                Number (DN) influences the pixel's color displayed. If one color channel's DN is higher, the pixel will appear 
                tinted in that color.</p>

                <h3>How Colors Mix</h3>
                <p>The system explains how primary colors combine:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Red + Green = Yellow</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Green + Blue = Cyan</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Red + Blue = Magenta</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Red + Green + Blue = White</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Understanding this system is key for interpreting digital imagery, including satellite images. When you create 
                false-color composites, you're using this additive system to assign different spectral bands to RGB channels.</p>

                <div class="note">
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> In a standard true-color composite, red band data is displayed through the red 
                    channel, green through green, and blue through blue. But in a false-color composite, you might display 
                    near-infrared data through the red channel, making vegetation appear red!</p>
                </div>

            <section id="image-collections">
                <h2>Image Collections</h2>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The purpose of this section is to introduce you to the many types of collections 
                of images available in Google Earth Engine. These include sets of individual satellite images, pre-made 
                composites (which merge multiple individual satellite images into one composite image), classified land use and 
                land cover (LULC) maps, weather data, and other types of datasets.</p>

                <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accessing and viewing sets of images in Earth Engine</li>
                    <li>Extracting single scenes from collections of images</li>
                    <li>Applying visualization parameters in Earth Engine to visualize an image</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Through the class, you have already been introduced to imagery, one of the core building blocks of remotely 
                sensed imagery in Earth Engine. In this module, we will expand on this concept of images by introducing 
                <code>ImageCollection</code>. Image collections in Earth Engine organize many different images into one larger 
                data storage structure. Image collections include information about the location, date collected, and other 
                properties of each image, allowing you to sift through the <code>ImageCollection</code> for the exact image 
                characteristics needed for your analysis.</p>

                <p>GEE image collections are available from a wide range of sources, including Landsat, Sentinel-2, MODIS, NASA 
                Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS), and DigitalGlobe. In addition to the pre-defined image collections, users 
                can also create custom image collections by combining multiple image collections into a single collection. This 
                can be useful for monitoring land cover or land use in a specific region.</p>

                <h3>Working with ImageCollections</h3>
                <p>In simplest terms, an <code>ImageCollection</code> is a stack or sequence of images. An 
                <code>ImageCollection</code> can be loaded by pasting an Earth Engine asset ID into the 
                <code>ImageCollection</code> constructor. You can find <code>ImageCollection</code> IDs in the 
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets" target="_blank">data catalog</a>.</p>

                <pre><code>// Load an ImageCollection
var collection = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S2');

// Filter to a specific area and date range
var filtered = collection
    .filterBounds(ee.Geometry.Point([-122.4194, 37.7749]))
    .filterDate('2020-06-01', '2020-09-01');

// Get the first image
var firstImage = filtered.first();

print('Number of images:', filtered.size());
Map.addLayer(firstImage, {bands: ['B4', 'B3', 'B2'], min: 0, max: 3000}, 'First Image');</code></pre>

            <section id="spectral-indices">
                <h2>Spectral Indices</h2>
                <p>Spectral indices in remote sensing are an important tool for analyzing data from satellites. This technique 
                harnesses the physics of solar radiation and the energy reflected from objects in different wavelengths to gain 
                new insight into phenomena.</p>

                <p>Spectral indices are based on the fact that different objects and land covers on the Earth's surface reflect 
                different amounts of light from the Sun at different wavelengths. Spectral indices provide a way to quantify the 
                differences between these wavelengths in visible and infrared light, which can be used to identify objects, 
                features, and patterns on the Earth's surface.</p>

                <h3>How Plants Reflect Light</h3>
                <p>In the visible part of the spectrum, for example, a healthy green plant reflects a large amount of green light 
                while absorbing blue and red light—which is why it appears green to our eyes. Light also arrives from the Sun at 
                wavelengths outside what the human eye can see, and there are large differences in reflectances between living and 
                nonliving land covers and between different types of vegetation, both in the visible and outside the visible 
                wavelengths.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/diagrams/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Spectral reflectance curves" loading="lazy">
                    <figcaption>Spectral reflectance curves for different land cover types</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>If we graph the amount of light (reflectance) at different wavelengths that an object or land cover reflects, 
                we can visualize this more easily. For example, look at the reflectance curves for dry bare soil and water. Soil 
                and water both have relatively low reflectance at wavelengths around 400 nm (blue light). Conversely, at 
                wavelengths above 700 nm (red and infrared light) soil has relatively high reflectance, while water has very low 
                reflectance. Vegetation, meanwhile, generally reflects large amounts of near-infrared light, relative to other 
                land covers.</p>

                <h3>NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index</h3>
                <p>A famous example of a spectral index is NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). NDVI is a tool used in 
                remote sensing to identify areas with healthy vegetation and to monitor changes in vegetation over time. It is 
                commonly used to measure the health of plants on the Earth's surface.</p>

                <p>NDVI is calculated by subtracting the visible red (R) band from the infrared (NIR) band, and then normalizing 
                the result by dividing by the sum of the two bands. This formula is written as:</p>

                <pre><code>NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)</code></pre>

                <div class="note">
                    <p><strong>NDVI Values:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>-1 to 0:</strong> Water, snow, clouds, or barren land</li>
                        <li><strong>0 to 0.3:</strong> Sparse vegetation, urban areas</li>
                        <li><strong>0.3 to 0.6:</strong> Moderate vegetation (grasslands, shrubs)</li>
                        <li><strong>0.6 to 1:</strong> Dense vegetation (forests, crops at peak growth)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Areas with healthy vegetation will have higher NDVI values, while those with degraded vegetation will have 
                lower NDVI values. Values close to -1 indicate a lack of vegetation, while values close to 1 indicate an 
                abundance of vegetation.</p>

                <h3>Applications of Spectral Indices</h3>
                <p>Indices derived from satellite imagery are used as the basis of many remote-sensing analyses. Indices have 
                been used in thousands of applications, from detecting anthropogenic deforestation to examining crop health. For 
                example, the growth of economically important crops such as wheat and cotton can be monitored throughout the 
                growing season: Bare soil reflects more red wavelengths, whereas growing crops reflect more near-infrared (NIR) 
                wavelengths. Thus, calculating a ratio of these two bands can help monitor how well crops are growing.</p>

                <p>Spectral indices can also be used to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assess the health and productivity of vegetation</li>
                    <li>Identify changes in chlorophyll content of plants</li>
                    <li>Detect various types of pollution and other environmental conditions</li>
                    <li>Monitor water quality and extent</li>
                    <li>Map urban areas and built-up regions</li>
                </ul>
