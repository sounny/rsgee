                This course textbook has been designed to be an educationally accessible introduction to remote sensing using Google Earth Engine. 
                Many of the materials in this textbook have been adapted and simplified to make remote sensing concepts more approachable 
                for students who are not familiar with remote sensing or programming.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The goal is to provide you with a solid foundation in remote sensing fundamentals, practical skills in Google Earth Engine, 
                and hands-on experience analyzing real-world environmental data—all presented in a way that is accessible and engaging.
