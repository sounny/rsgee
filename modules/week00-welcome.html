                <h2>Welcome to Class</h2>
                <p>Welcome to an exciting journey through Remote Sensing and Digital Image Processing! This course is designed 
                for both undergraduate and graduate students, under the names "Digital Image Processing" for undergraduates and 
                "Remote Sensing" for graduates. The terminology naming the course is a good reflection of what we will be doing; 
                in essence, we are processing imagery from satellites to get a better understanding of a Big Blue World.</p>

                <p>The course goes beyond traditional remote sensing, extending into web programming and integrating cutting-edge 
                technologies like Google Earth Engine. For those of you who may not be familiar, Google Earth Engine is a 
                transformative tool in the field of remote sensing, allowing us to work with massive datasets and powerful 
                cloud-based computational resources.</p>

                <p>Are you worried about the programming component? <strong>Don't be!</strong> This course is designed to be 
                inclusive of all skill levels. Even if you've never written a line of code, you'll find the environment friendly 
                and conducive to learning. We'll be looking at a lot of great topics from an introductory perspective, like big 
                data, artificial intelligence, and web visualizations, all while equipping you with the programming skills 
                essential for modern GIS and remote sensing careers.</p>

                <p>We find ourselves in an era where the landscape of GIS and remote sensing is evolving rapidly. The course will 
                give you a front-row seat to this transformation from desktop-based systems to cloud computing and back again. 
                This is more than just a class; it's your gateway to understanding and participating in the ongoing revolution in 
                remote sensing and geospatial technologies! I look forward to digitally exploring the world with you this semester.</p>

                <h2>The Earth Engine API</h2>
                <p>Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform for scientific data analysis. It provides ready-to-use, 
                cloud-hosted datasets and a large pool of servers. One feature that makes Earth Engine particularly attractive is 
                its ability to run large computations quickly by distributing them across a large pool of servers. The Earth 
                Engine API enables the ability to use cloud-hosted datasets and computation efficiently.</p>

                <p>An API is a way to communicate with Earth Engine servers. It allows you to specify what computation you want 
                to do and then receive the results. The API is designed so that users do not need to worry about <em>how</em> the 
                computation is distributed across a cluster of machines and the results are assembled. Users of the API specify 
                what needs to be done. This greatly simplifies the code by hiding the implementation detail from the users. It 
                also makes Earth Engine very approachable for users unfamiliar with writing code.</p>

                <p>Earth Engine API is designed to be language agnostic. Google provides official client libraries to use the API 
                from both JavaScript and Python. The API remains largely the same regardless of the programming language you use. 
                The main difference is the syntax used to call the API functions. Once you learn the syntax for programming 
                languages, your code can be adapted easily because they all use the same API functions.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="why-javascript">
                <h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>
                <p>JavaScript may not be the first choice of programming language for many researchers and data scientists, and 
                some may be wondering why this course is based on JavaScript API instead of Python or R.</p>

                <p>The Earth Engine JavaScript API is the most mature and easiest to use when getting started. The Earth Engine 
                platform comes with a web-based Code Editor that allows you to use the Earth Engine JavaScript API without any 
                installation. It also provides additional functionality to display your results on a map, save your scripts, 
                access documentation, manage tasks, and more. It has a one-click mechanism to share your code with other users—
                allowing for easy reproducibility and collaboration. In addition, the JavaScript API comes with a user interface 
                library, which allows you to create charts and web-based applications with little effort.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>You do not need to become a JavaScript expert in using Earth Engine. The basic syntax described here should be 
                sufficient. A good tip is that if you find yourself doing something complicated in JavaScript, it might be done 
                much better in Earth Engine. All the important computations in Earth Engine need to use the API functions, and 
                even a basic operation—such as adding two numbers in Earth Engine—should be done using the Earth Engine API.</p>

                <h2>Earth from Space</h2>
                <p>Remote sensing allows us to observe our planet from a unique vantage point - space. Satellites orbiting Earth 
                continuously collect data about our planet's surface, atmosphere, and oceans. This bird's-eye view provides 
                insights impossible to obtain from ground-level observations alone.</p>

                <p>Through remote sensing, we can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monitor environmental changes over time</li>
                    <li>Track deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural patterns</li>
                    <li>Assess natural disasters and their impacts</li>
                    <li>Study climate change and its effects</li>
                    <li>Manage natural resources more effectively</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In this course, you'll learn to harness the power of satellite imagery to answer important questions about our 
                changing planet.</p>
