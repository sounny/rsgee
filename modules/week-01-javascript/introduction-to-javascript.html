<p><span>JavaScript is a programming language created in the mid-1990s by Brendan Eich. It is one of the most widely used languages in the world and is used to power the web. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language that runs in the user's web browser, allowing developers to create dynamic, interactive websites and applications. It has become immensely popular due to its versatility, making it a top choice for both back-end and front-end developers. </span></p>
<p><span>JavaScript’s unique syntax allows it to be used for various tasks, from basic website development to complex web applications. It is also used to develop mobile apps and desktop software. JavaScript’s popularity has continued to grow significantly over the years, and it is now used in nearly every facet of web development.</span></p>
<p><span>In remote sensing, the popularity of browser-based cloud computing products like Google Earth Engine has made JavaScript more important than ever.&nbsp; In order to utilize the full capabilities, </span><span>you will need to use JavaScript. This module covers the JavaScript syntax and basic data structures. In the module, you will see more JavaScript code. As you encounter code, paste it into the Code Editor and run the script to follow along.&nbsp;</span></p>
