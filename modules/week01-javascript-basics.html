                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This module introduces the basic JavaScript concepts you'll need to work effectively in Google Earth Engine. 
                Don't worry if you've never programmed before - we'll start from the very beginning and build up your skills 
                gradually.</p>

            <section id="variables">
                <h2>Variables</h2>
                <p>In a programming language, variables are used to store data values. In JavaScript, a variable is defined using 
                the <strong>var</strong> keyword followed by the name of the variable. The code below assigns the text 
                "Gainesville" to the variable named city.</p>

                <pre><code>var city = 'Gainesville';</code></pre>

                <div class="note">
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Text strings in the code should be surrounded by quotes. You are free to use either 
                    ' (single quotes) or " (double quotes), and they must match at the beginning and end of each string. In your 
                    programs, it is advisable to be consistent—use either single quotes or double quotes throughout a given script 
                    (the code in this book generally uses single quotes for code). Each statement of your script should typically 
                    end with a semicolon, although Earth Engine's code editor does not require it.</p>
                </div>

                <p>If you print the variable city, you will get the value stored in the variable (Gainesville) printed in the 
                Console.</p>

                <pre><code>print(city);</code></pre>

                <p>When you assign a text value, the variable is automatically assigned the type <strong>string</strong>. You can 
                also assign numbers to variables and create variables of type <strong>number</strong>. The following code creates 
                a new variable called population and assigns a number as its value.</p>

                <pre><code>var population = 140398;
print(population);</code></pre>

            <section id="lists">
                <h2>Lists (Arrays)</h2>
                <p>It is helpful to store multiple values in a single variable. JavaScript provides a data structure called a 
                list (also known as an array) that can hold multiple values. We can create a new list using the square brackets 
                [ ] and add multiple values separated by a comma. Try putting this code into your console and running it.</p>

                <pre><code>var cities = ['Gainesville', 'Tampa Bay', 'Orlando', 'Miami'];
print(cities);</code></pre>

                <p>If you look at the output in the Console, you will see "List" with an expander arrow (▹) next to it. Clicking 
                on the arrow will expand the list and show you its content. You will notice that along with the four items in the 
                list, there is a number next to each value. This is the <strong>index</strong> of each item. It allows you to 
                refer to each item in the list using a numeric value that indicates its position in the list.</p>

                </figure>

                <div class="note">
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> In JavaScript (and most programming languages), lists are zero-indexed. This 
                    means the first item has an index of 0, the second item has an index of 1, and so on.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section id="objects">
                <h2>Objects (Dictionaries)</h2>
                <p>Objects are another useful data structure in JavaScript. While lists store ordered collections of values, 
                objects store key-value pairs. This makes them perfect for storing related data with descriptive names.</p>

                <pre><code>var cityInfo = {
  name: 'Gainesville',
  population: 140398,
  state: 'Florida',
  coordinates: [-82.3248, 29.6516]
};

print(cityInfo);</code></pre>

                <p>You can access individual properties of an object using dot notation:</p>

                <pre><code>print('City name:', cityInfo.name);
print('Population:', cityInfo.population);</code></pre>

                <p>Or using bracket notation:</p>

                <pre><code>print('State:', cityInfo['state']);</code></pre>

                <div class="note">
                    <p><strong>When to use lists vs. objects:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use <strong>lists</strong> when you have an ordered collection of similar items (e.g., a list of 
                        cities, dates, or numbers)</li>
                        <li>Use <strong>objects</strong> when you want to store related properties with descriptive names 
                        (e.g., information about a single city)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section id="functions">
                <h2>Functions</h2>
                <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help you organize your code and avoid 
                repetition. In JavaScript, you can define a function using the <strong>function</strong> keyword:</p>

                <pre><code>function greet(name) {
  var message = 'Hello, ' + name + '!';
  return message;
}

print(greet('Alice'));  // Output: Hello, Alice!
print(greet('Bob'));    // Output: Hello, Bob!</code></pre>

                <p>Functions can take <strong>parameters</strong> (inputs) and <strong>return</strong> values (outputs). This 
                makes them incredibly powerful for processing data.</p>

                <h3>Functions in Earth Engine</h3>
                <p>In Google Earth Engine, you'll often use functions to process images and image collections. For example:</p>

                <pre><code>// Function to calculate NDVI
function calculateNDVI(image) {
  var ndvi = image.normalizedDifference(['B8', 'B4']);
  return ndvi;
}

// Apply the function to an image
var ndviImage = calculateNDVI(myImage);</code></pre>
            </section>

            <section id="comments">
                <h2>Comments</h2>
                <p>Comments are essential for making your code readable and maintainable. They allow you to explain what your 
                code does without affecting how it runs.</p>

                <pre><code>// This is a single-line comment

/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  You can use it to explain more complex code.
  Everything between the opening and closing markers is a comment.
*/

var city = 'Gainesville';  // You can also add comments at the end of lines</code></pre>

                <div class="warning">
                    <p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Comment your code liberally! Your future self (and your collaborators) 
                    will thank you. Good comments explain <em>why</em> you're doing something, not just <em>what</em> you're 
                    doing.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

                <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create variables for your name, age, and hometown. Print them to the console.</li>
                    <li>Create a list of your five favorite cities. Print the list and then print just the third city.</li>
                    <li>Create an object that stores information about yourself (name, major, year, favorite remote sensing 
                    application).</li>
                    <li>Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.</li>
                    <li>Add comments to explain each section of your code.</li>
                </ol>
