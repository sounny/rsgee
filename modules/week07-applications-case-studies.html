            <section id="fluvial-geomorphology">
                <h2>Case Study: Fluvial Geomorphology</h2>
                
                <p>One of the case studies you'll explore examines river systems from space—a field called <strong>fluvial geomorphology</strong>. This application demonstrates how Earth Engine enables large-scale analysis of dynamic natural systems.</p>

                <h3>River Planview Geometry</h3>
                <p>When you look at a river from above—what we call its "planview geometry"—you're essentially peering into a wealth of information about that river system. It's like a fingerprint, unique to each river, revealing intricate details about its life story. This overhead view can tell us about the river's morphological evolution, how water and sediment move through its channel, and much more.</p>

                <h3>Hydraulic Geometry and Rating Curves</h3>
                <p>One well-established theory in fluvial geomorphology is that of <strong>hydraulic geometry</strong>. It suggests a power-law relation, known as a "rating curve," between a river's width and discharge. So, if you know the width of a river at a certain point, you can make educated guesses about its discharge level.</p>

                <p>This is a powerful insight that has modern applications. For instance, <strong>remote sensing images can measure a river's width and, consequently, monitor its discharge</strong>. This is particularly useful in regions where in-situ measurements are difficult to obtain.</p>

                <h3>Meandering and Morphological Changes</h3>
                <p>Rivers are not static; they are more like living organisms that evolve. As water moves from higher elevations to lower ones, rivers adjust their courses through a process known as <strong>meandering</strong>. This leads to lateral shifts in the river's course, driven by the erosion and accretion of sediment along the banks.</p>

                <p>Understanding these changes is essential for various applications, from flood management to environmental conservation.</p>

                <h3>The Technological Evolution</h3>

                <h4>Early Days: Manual Interpretation</h4>
                <p>Scientists relied heavily on aerial imagery in the early stages of studying rivers. These images were manually interpreted to deduce the characteristics of river systems—a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. But it was a start, giving us invaluable insights into river morphology.</p>

                <h4>The Digital Revolution: Automated Processing</h4>
                <p>Fast forward to the 21st century, and we've seen exponential growth in computing power and data availability:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>RivWidth software</strong> (Pavelsky and Smith 2008) first presented an automated method for river width extraction</li>
                    <li><strong>RivWidthCloud (RWC)</strong> (Yang et al. 2019) later applied and expanded these methods to Earth Engine</li>
                    <li>Methods for detecting changes in river form evolved from simple tools tracking hand-drawn centerlines (Shields et al. 2000) to automated methods processing entire basins (Constantine et al. 2014, Rowland et al. 2016)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Modern Capabilities: Large-Scale, Cloud-Based Analyses</h4>
                <p>The capabilities of Earth Engine have dovetailed nicely with the needs of modern fluvial geomorphology. This platform allows for <strong>large-scale, high-speed data analysis</strong> that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. With Earth Engine, researchers and policymakers now have a powerful tool for understanding and managing one of the planet's most vital natural resources: its rivers.</p>
